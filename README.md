# frequentPattern.py
Generate frequent itemsets from vocab.txt and topic-i.txt to patterns/pattern-i.txt (where 0 <= i <= 4) using Apriori.

## vocab.txt
A dictionary that maps a term to an index.<br>
format: index	term<br>
Columns are separated by a tab.

## topi-i.txt
Input file of frequent pattern mining algorithms. Each line represents a transaction with indices of terms.<br>
format: term1_index term2_index term3_index ...<br>
Columns are separated by a space.

## pattern-i.txt
Output file of frequent pattern mining algorithms. Each line represents a transaction with frequent itemsets sorted in descending order of support count.<br>
format: support_count	term1 term2 ...<br>
support_count and term1 are separated by a tab, while terms are separated by a space.

## Usage
- topic-i.txt and vocab.txt should be at the same level as where frequentPattern.py is
- a directory called patterns should be created first
- command to run the script: python frequentPattern.py

# closedPattern.py
Generate closed patterns from patterns/pattern-i.txt to closed/closed-i.txt (where 0 <= i <= 4).

## closed-i.txt
The format is the same as pattern-i.txt.

## Usage
- frequentPattern.py should be run first to generate the required input files patterns/pattern-i.txt
- a directory called closed should be created first
- command to run the script: python closedPattern.py

# maxPattern.py
Generate max patterns from patterns/pattern-i.txt to max/max-i.txt (where 0 <= i <= 4).

## max-i.txt
The format is the same as pattern-i.txt.

## Usage
- frequentPattern.py should be run first to generate the required input files patterns/pattern-i.txt
- a directory called max should be created first
- command to run the script: python maxPattern.py
